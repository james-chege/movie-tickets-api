An app that allows users to make bookings for a movie.

#### Key components

The key files and directories to look at are:
1. `middleware/`
2. `routes/`
2. `controllers/`
3. `utils/`

#### Middleware

When a request is received the aim is to invoke a controller function to process it. Before the controller function is
hit we have middleware to perform checks.

#### Routes

The routes directory is made up of routers named after the system entity they represent. All the routers are registered
to the application in `index.js`


#### Utils

The `utils/` directory defines functions that are used throughout the app to simplify code and separate concerns.
